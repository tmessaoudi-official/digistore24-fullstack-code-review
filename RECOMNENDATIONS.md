# Future Recommendations

If I had more time, here are the features and improvements I would implement, prioritized by impact:

---

## High Priority (Production Essentials)

### 1. Real-Time Updates with Mercure (with FrankenPHP)
**What:**
- Implement Mercure Hub for Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- Push new messages to clients in real-time
- No need for polling or WebSocket complexity

**Why:**
- **Better UX**: Messages appear instantly without refresh
- **Scalability**: Mercure handles thousands of concurrent connections
- **Symfony Integration**: Native support with MercureBundle
- **Standard**: Built on W3C Server-Sent Events specification

---

### 2. Refresh Token Implementation
**What:**
- Add refresh token endpoint (`POST /api/auth/refresh`)
- Store refresh tokens in database with expiration
- Automatic token refresh in frontend interceptor

**Why:**
- **Security**: Short-lived access tokens (15 min) with long-lived refresh tokens (7 days)
- **UX**: Users stay logged in without re-entering credentials
- **Best Practice**: Industry standard for JWT authentication

---

### 3. Message Pagination
**What:**
- Implement cursor-based pagination for messages
- Add `limit` and `cursor` query parameters
- Return pagination metadata in response

**Why:**
- **Performance**: Don't load all messages at once
- **Scalability**: Handles thousands of messages efficiently
- **UX**: Infinite scroll or "Load More" button

---

### 4. Rate Limiting
**What:**
- Implement rate limiting per user/IP
- Limit message creation (e.g., 10 messages per minute)
- Limit authentication attempts (e.g., 5 login attempts per hour)

**Why:**
- **Security**: Prevent spam and brute-force attacks
- **Stability**: Protect server from abuse
- **Fair Usage**: Ensure resources for all users

---

### 5. Email Verification
**What:**
- Send verification email on registration
- Users must verify email before sending messages
- Add `email_verified_at` field to User entity

**Why:**
- **Security**: Prevents fake accounts
- **Communication**: Ensures valid email for notifications
- **Best Practice**: Standard for user registration
---

### 6. Chatbot Improvements
**What:**
- Add more sophisticated chatbot plugins:
  - Read AI bot
  - Weather plugin (fetch from API)
  - Translation plugin (translate messages)
  - Reminder plugin (schedule messages)
  - FAQ plugin (answer common questions)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) for better intent detection
- Chatbot analytics (track usage, popular queries)

**Why:**
- **Automation**: Reduce manual support work
- **UX**: Instant answers to common questions

---
### 7. Proper Docker & CI/CD
**What:**
- Complete Docker Compose setup (PHP, PostgreSQL, Redis, Mercure)
- GitHub Actions for automated testing
- Automated deployment to staging/production
- Database migrations in deployment pipeline

**Why:**
- **DevOps**: Consistent environments
- **Quality**: Automated testing catches bugs
- **Speed**: Fast, reliable deployments

---

### 8. CDN Integration
**What:**
- Serve static assets (JS, CSS, images) via CDN
- Use CloudFlare or AWS CloudFront
- Optimize images automatically

**Why:**
- **Performance**: Faster load times globally
- **Bandwidth**: Reduce server load

---
## Medium Priority (Enhanced Features)

### 1. File Attachments
**What:**
- Allow users to attach images/files to messages
- Store files in cloud storage (S3, CloudFlare R2)
- Generate thumbnails for images
- Virus scanning for uploads

**Why:**
- **Feature Completeness**: Modern chat apps support attachments
- **UX**: Richer communication

---

## Technical Improvements

### 1. Database Optimization
**What:**
- Add indexes on frequently queried columns
- Optimize N+1 queries with eager loading
- Implement database query caching
- Use database connection pooling

---

### 2. Code Quality Tools
**What:**
- PHPStan (static analysis) at max level
- SonarQube for code quality metrics
- Automated code review in CI/CD

---

### 3. Performance Testing
**What:**
- Load testing with Apache JMeter or k6
- Stress testing to find breaking points
- Performance benchmarks for API endpoints
